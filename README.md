Pok√©mon Analysis Using Python
This project is an analysis of the Pokemon dataset containing various Pokemon names, their types, character statistics such as speed, defense, health, attack, and special powers, as well as Pokemon generations and legendary Pokemon.

The analysis steps are:
1. Dataset Exploration: Know the meaning of the various columns, the relationships between columns, and understand the contents of each column.
2. Analyze Data: From the existing dataset, the data is appropriate so that no data cleaning and transformation is needed. The next step is to analyze the data using python such as data info and analysis of pokemon
3. Data Visualization: At this stage, visualization is done in Google Colaboratory using python. Visualization here displays column charts, line charts, pie charts to show a deeper analysis of pokemon.
